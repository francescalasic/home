            <h3>Melodoodle</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Melodoodle is an interactive educational game designed to stimulate children's creativity through music. The heart of the project is the wearable device that translates movements into sounds, allowing children to "draw melodies." The piano-shaped packaging and comic-style instruction manual complete the game, making it engaging and fun.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Melodoodle was a project that allowed me to combine my passion for drawing and design with a more technical and hands-on approach, working closely with a team. From the very beginning, I actively contributed to the project's aesthetics, from creating the initial sketches to the final packaging. I designed a piano-shaped box that would capture the child's attention while being functional to contain all the game elements. At the same time, I worked on developing the comic-style instruction manual, designed to help parents explain the game in a simple and fun way.</p>
            <p>From a user perspective, I actively participated in research, conducting interviews with parents and children. This helped me understand how important it is to design with real people's needs in mind, not just focusing on the product's aesthetics. For this reason, I proposed the inclusion of collaborative modes, as social interaction turned out to be a key element for engaging children.</p>
            <p>I am very satisfied with the work done on Melodoodle. The project successfully combined aesthetics, functionality, and a strong connection with the end user.</p>

            <h3>Study Buddy</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Study Buddy is a study companion that helps students stay focused and productive during study sessions. Its interactive design encourages students to put away their phones and focus on studying. The flower on top opens and closes based on the study cycle, signaling when itâ€™s time for a break and when to resume. Additionally, Study Buddy is equipped with sensors to monitor the study environment and improve efficiency.</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project allowed me to develop technical and creative skills in a field I had never explored before, such as integrating sensors and programming interactive devices. Using Arduino to control various components, including the timer, light, noise, and air quality sensors, allowed me to learn a completely new programming language and explore the workings of different sensors.</p>
            <p>In the design process, I focused on balancing aesthetics and functionality. I wanted study Buddy to be visually appealing to teenagers while also being highly functional. The ability to use the flower as a timer and respond dynamically to the study environment was one of the most interesting challenges of the project.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am very satisfied with the results achieved. Study Buddy not only meets the functional requirements of a study companion but also offers a fun and friendly design, making it a useful and enjoyable product to use and attractive to teenagers.</p>
